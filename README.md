# CineSpark Insights

## Overview
CineSpark Insights is a data-driven project aimed at providing deep insights into the world of movies. Utilizing the power of Apache Spark, this project analyzes the [MovieLens 25M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) to uncover patterns and predictions in movie ratings and preferences.

### Objectives
- To perform extensive data analysis and manipulation using Spark RDDs and DataFrames.
- To build and compare machine learning models using Spark MLlib for predicting movie ratings.
- To gain actionable insights through data visualizations and model predictions.
